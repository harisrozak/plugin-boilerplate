#### The Long Version ####

Here you can place a longer description of the plugin and its features, separated into paragraphs.

    code snippet is indented with four spaces;

#### Compatibility ####

This plugin has been designed for use on LEMP (Nginx) web servers with PHP 7.0 and MySQL 5.7 to achieve best performance. All of our plugins are meant for single site WordPress installations only; for both performance and security reasons, we highly recommend against using WordPress Multisite for the vast majority of projects.

Note: Any WordPress plugin may also be loaded as "Must-Use" by using the [Autoloader](https://github.com/littlebizzy/autoloader) script within the `mu-plugins` directory.

#### Defined Constants ####

The following defined constants are supported by this plugin:

* `define('DISABLE_NAG_NOTICES', true);`

Why no quotes? Adding quotes evaluates the 'false' or "false" values as a string, and the boolean evaluation of any string returns true (except for empty strings).

It is a little bit weird but PHP works this way because it does not require strong data typing. There are special operatos (the triple equality ===) to ensure the right data type, but adds complexity and it is used normally where you are not sure of the input variable data type.

It is true that there are constants that expects both boolean and string values, but the important thing here is that the false value does not contain quotes, e.g.:

define('DISABLE_CART_FRAGMENTS', true);
define('DISABLE_CART_FRAGMENTS', false);
define('DISABLE_CART_FRAGMENTS', '123,456,789');

#### Nag Notices ####

This plugin generates multiple [Admin Notices](https://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Action_Reference/admin_notices) in the WP Admin dashboard. The first is a notice that fires during plugin activation which recommends several related free plugins that we believe will enhance this plugin's features; this notice will re-appear approximately once every 6 months as our code and recommendations evolve. The second is a notice that fires a few days after plugin activation which asks for a 5-star rating of this plugin on its WordPress.org profile page. This notice will re-appear approximately once every 9 months. These notices can be dismissed by clicking the **(x)** symbol in the upper right of the notice box. These notices may annoy or confuse certain users, but are appreciated by the majority of our userbase, who understand that these notices support our free contributions to the WordPress community while providing valuable (free) recommendations for optimizing their website.

If you feel that these notices are too annoying, than we encourage you to consider one or more of our upcoming premium plugins that combine several free plugin features into a single control panel, or even consider developing your own plugins for WordPress, if supporting free plugin authors is too frustrating for you. A final alternative would be to place the defined constant mentioned below inside of your `wp-config.php` file to manually hide this plugin's nag notices:

    define('DISABLE_NAG_NOTICES', true);

Note: This defined constant will only affect the notices mentioned above, and will not affect any other notices generated by this plugin or other plugins, such as one-time notices that communicate with admin-level users.

#### Disclaimer ####

We released this plugin in response to our managed hosting clients asking for better access to their server, and our primary goal will remain supporting that purpose. Although we are 100% open to fielding requests from the WordPress community, we kindly ask that you keep the above-mentioned goals in mind... thanks!

### Philosophy ####

Inspired by the likes of Unix and W. Edwards Deming, we believe in creating high quality software "components" that can stand on their own, or be integrated into other software. At a certain point, this approach has practical limits, which is why we are beginning to combine certain features into premium plugins. Still, we aim to reduce redundancy wherever possible, and present a unified UI in our premium plugins that in fact combines multiple small indepdent functions behind the scenes.
